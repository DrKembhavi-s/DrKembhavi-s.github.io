# Beyond MBBS: The Role of Parents in Shaping BAMS Careers

**Beyond MBBS: The Role of Parents in Shaping BAMS Careers**

**Tagline:** *When parental perceptions decide futures, Ayurveda pays the price.*

In India, the dream of becoming a doctor often begins and ends with three golden letters: **MBBS**. It is considered the ultimate benchmark of medical education, while other systems of medicine, especially **BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery)**, are often treated as fallback options. This perception is not only shaping the lives of thousands of young students but also defining the trajectory of Ayurveda as a medical science.

**The Numbers Game: NEET and the “Second Choice” Dilemma**

Every aspiring doctor in India must clear **NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)**. But the competition is fierce—securing a seat in a good MBBS college demands nearly **600 out of 720 marks**, while the eligibility itself starts at just 110–140.This wide gap creates a funnel: students who score between **110–250** often find themselves in BAMS programs, not because they chose Ayurveda, but because MBBS was out of reach.

**Parents and Their Limited Understanding of BAMS**

Here lies the crux of the issue: most parents know little about BAMS beyond its association with Ayurveda. To them, it is not perceived as a **professional medical system** but rather a compromise. As a result, parental expectations tend to be minimal:

- *“Just pass and somehow practice allopathy.”*
- *“For daughters, BAMS is a ticket to find an MBBS groom.”*

Such attitudes reduce BAMS to a stepping stone rather than a career in its own right.

**Gender Dynamics: Numbers That Tell a Story**

Interestingly, more **girls than boys** are admitted into BAMS. Yet, only a small fraction of them pursue active medical practice after graduation. This imbalance reinforces the notion that BAMS, for many families, is not truly about healthcare but about social status and matrimonial advantages.

**The Societal Cost of Parental Perceptions**

When parents dismiss BAMS as “second best,” the ripple effects are profound:

- **Students lack motivation** to explore Ayurveda’s depth, often passing exams without passion.
- **Ayurveda loses credibility** as a professional science, stuck in the shadow of MBBS.
- **Society misses out** on a robust cadre of skilled Ayurvedic practitioners who could bridge gaps in India’s strained healthcare system.

Instead of producing confident, research-oriented Ayurvedic doctors, we are creating graduates who either drift towards practicing allopathy without formal training or abandon the profession altogether.

**Ayurveda at the Crossroads**

Ayurveda has a rich legacy and growing global recognition, especially in areas like holistic wellness, chronic disease management, and integrative medicine. But in India, where it should have its strongest foundation, it often struggles because students and their parents do not fully value its potential.

For Ayurveda to thrive, parental involvement must go beyond securing a degree for their children. It should involve:

- **Educating themselves** about Ayurveda’s scope.
- **Encouraging genuine interest** rather than treating BAMS as a consolation prize.
- **Supporting research and specialization** so that their children can contribute meaningfully to the healthcare ecosystem.

**Conclusion: Parents as Gatekeepers of Change**

Parents hold immense power in shaping how their children perceive their careers. When they recognize BAMS as a legitimate and respected medical path, students will approach it with pride, dedication, and vision. Until then, Ayurveda risks being sidelined—not because of lack of potential, but because of lack of awareness and conviction.

**Ultimately, the future of Ayurveda is not just in the hands of policymakers or institutions—it begins in the living rooms of Indian households, with parents deciding whether their children will be healers or merely degree holders.**
