# When Good Intentions Fall Short: How Present NCISM-Driven Teaching Methodologies are Failing Ayurveda and Its Students

## Abstract

Recent reforms in Ayurveda education under the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine (NCISM) promise modernization and standardization but reveal persistent shortcomings in curricular design, pedagogy, and clinical training. Drawing on peer-reviewed literature and policy documents, this article critically evaluates the effectiveness of current methodologies, highlighting barriers to producing competent, adaptive Ayurvedic practitioners. Recommendations for evidence-based transformation are advanced.

## Introduction

### The Significance of Effective Teaching in Ayurveda

Effective pedagogy is vital in shaping skilled healthcare professionals, particularly in systems rooted in tradition like Ayurveda. With its legacy of holistic patient care and preventive health, Ayurveda's educational mission must bridge classical knowledge with contemporary healthcare realities, ensuring its graduates possess both deep theoretical grounding and robust clinical competence.

### NCISM's Role and the Intent Behind Reforms

Responding to calls for quality, transparency, and accountability, the Indian government established the NCISM under the 2020 Act to regulate Ayurveda education nationally. The intent behind these reforms includes standardized curricula, uniform admission standards, research integration, practical training, and professional accreditation, aiming to elevate Ayurveda's credibility and ensure practitioner capability for a modern world.

### Persisting Gaps Between Intent and Outcomes

Despite progressive reforms, Ayurveda colleges remain hindered by didactic content delivery, limited clinical engagement, and underwhelming research orientation. Students and educators often flag inadequacies in hands-on skills and critical thinking development. This disconnect between aspiration and reality threatens both student readiness and public faith in Ayurveda.

## Literature Review

### Historical Evolution and Traditional Models

The shift from the *Gurukula* model—based on close mentorship and experiential learning—to mass college education has eroded the intimacy and efficacy of Ayurveda training. Where small student groups once learned through immersion and dialog with masters, modern systems prioritize standardized curricula and examination, often to the detriment of adaptability and authentic skill transfer.

### NCISM-Era Curricular Mandates

NCISM's curriculum reforms emphasize standardized content, admissions (via NEET and AIAPGET), and assessments, as well as the establishment of autonomous boards and skill labs. However, implementation focuses heavily on physical infrastructure rather than pedagogical renewal, with little emphasis on critical appraisal of what content should be retained, updated, or discarded for modern practice.

### Deficiencies Documented in the Literature

Numerous studies report that current teaching remains largely theory-focused, with insufficient integration of practical, clinical, and research-based competencies. Outdated topics persist, and student exposure to research and interdisciplinary learning is limited. This perpetuates a cycle in which graduates often lack the confidence and skill set necessary for independent practice or innovation in public health.

## Methodology

This review draws on a qualitative analysis of primary literature, policy documents, and government reports published in recent years. Peer-reviewed journal articles were sourced using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, and gray literature included NCISM official curricula and notifications. Thematic analysis was employed to identify recurring patterns, successes, and persistent challenges in Ayurveda education as articulated by scholars, educators, and regulators.

## Critical Analysis

### Strengths of NCISM-Driven Reforms

- Introduced uniform admission standards nationwide, improving access and quality control
- Standardized degrees promote national and international mobility for graduates
- Research requirements, digital platforms, and skill labs—where implemented—are promising for future integration and technological adoption

### Persistent Weaknesses

- **Didactic Focus:** Overemphasis on lecture-based teaching at the expense of experiential and competency-based approaches
- **Outdated Content:** Curriculum retains archaic or unchallenged theories, sometimes overlooking contemporary healthcare needs and interdisciplinary insights
- **Clinical Exposure:** Limited, often poorly supervised clinical postings; few opportunities for real-world patient care under expert mentorship
- **Faculty Training:** Many instructors lack formal pedagogic training or research orientation, perpetuating a transmission model of teaching
- **Student Impact:** Surveys and qualitative interviews consistently show that students feel insufficiently prepared for independent practice, research, or integrative health care roles

### Comparative Insights

Compared with medical education best practices globally, the Indian Ayurveda education system falls short in fostering lifelong learning, critical thinking, and innovation. Most successful reforms in other fields blend digital learning, hybrid clinical simulations, interdisciplinary collaboration, and frequent curriculum revision—features currently lacking or nascent in Ayurveda colleges.

## Discussion

### Implications for Graduate Competence and Professional Standards

The current gap between curriculum intent and execution results in graduates with variable readiness, diminishing public trust and undermining Ayurveda's standing alongside allopathic medicine in India and abroad. Without urgent pedagogic renewal and more robust clinical training, Ayurveda risks marginalization as an evidence-based health care option.

### Lessons from Global and Integrative Models

Effective educational systems globally focus on competency-based curricula, problem-solving, clinical immersion, and cross-disciplinary research. For Ayurveda, balancing classical doctrines with evidence-based practice, digital tools, and population health needs will be vital.

## Recommendations

1. **Curriculum Review**: Establish transparent mechanisms to update and critically appraise curricular content
2. **Pedagogic Renewal**: Invest in faculty development and blended learning strategies, prioritizing skill acquisition over mere content delivery
3. **Clinical Training**: Expand supervised, community-based, and simulation-based clinical opportunities for students
4. **Research Integration**: Make basic biomedical and research-oriented education mandatory within the graduate curriculum
5. **Assessment Reform**: Shift evaluation focus towards demonstration of competencies (skills, application, professionalism)
6. **Career Pathways**: Link continuous professional development and re-licensure to demonstrable learning and skills

## Conclusion

While NCISM-led reforms represent an important step forward, real progress will require a deeper commitment to pedagogic innovation, curriculum renewal, meaningful mentorship, and alignment with best practices from both global and traditional fields. Only then can Ayurveda education realize its potential to produce competent, confident practitioners equipped for the demands of 21st-century healthcare.
