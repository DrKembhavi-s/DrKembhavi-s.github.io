# Why BAMS Students Must Study The Original Samhitas Beyond Textbook Medicine

**Why BAMS Students Must Study the Original Samhitas: Beyond Textbook Medicine**

**Dr Aakash Kembhavi**

MD, PGDMLS, MS (Counseling &amp; Psychotherapy)

**Introduction: A Crisis of Shallow Learning**

Let's confront an uncomfortable truth that plagues Ayurvedic medical education today: **most BAMS students are graduating without ever truly studying the foundational texts of their own system of medicine.**

Instead, there's a disturbing trend—downloading PDFs of condensed notes, relying entirely on guidebooks written for examination purposes, cramming content two months before exams, and considering this sufficient preparation to become an Ayurvedic physician. This approach is not just inadequate; it's a betrayal of the profound wisdom you've chosen to inherit.

The Samhitas—Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya—are not ancient relics to be referenced occasionally. They are living, breathing texts that contain the complete philosophy, diagnostic methods, therapeutic approaches, and clinical wisdom of Ayurveda. Yet, most students never engage with them directly, relying instead on poorly written, copy-pasted textbooks that offer no depth, no insight, and no analytical rigor.

This article is a wake-up call and a sincere appeal: **return to the original texts. Study the Samhitas with their Sanskrit commentaries. Engage with the source material that has guided healers for millennia.**

**The Problem with Modern BAMS Textbooks**

**The Uncomfortable Reality**

Walk into any BAMS student's room, and you'll likely find:

- Stacks of photocopied notes from seniors
- Downloaded PDF compilations from various WhatsApp groups
- Guidebooks designed solely to help pass university exams
- Perhaps one or two prescribed textbooks that are themselves compilations

What you're unlikely to find:

- A copy of Charaka Samhita with Chakrapani's commentary
- Sushruta Samhita with Dalhana's commentary
- Ashtanga Hridaya with Arunadatta's commentary
- Sanskrit dictionary or grammar books
- Any evidence of serious engagement with original texts

**Why Most Recommended Textbooks Fail You**

**1. They Are Copy-Paste Compilations**

Most modern BAMS textbooks are not original scholarly works. Authors copy content from other textbooks, which were themselves copied from earlier books, creating a chain of increasingly diluted information. By the time content reaches you, it's:

- Oversimplified to the point of losing meaning
- Stripped of context and nuance
- Filled with errors perpetuated through multiple generations of copying
- Devoid of the original logic and reasoning

**2. Poor Language and Grammar**

Open any random BAMS textbook and you'll notice:

- Awkward, unclear sentence construction
- Grammatical errors throughout
- Confusing explanations that complicate rather than clarify
- Sanskrit shlokas with incorrect transliterations
- Translations that miss the original meaning entirely
- Inconsistent terminology

How can you learn precise medical knowledge from imprecise language?

**3. No Analytical Depth**

These books present information as lists to memorize:

- "Charaka says there are 20 types of Krimi" (without explaining the classification logic)
- "These are the symptoms of Amlapitta" (without discussing pathogenesis)
- "Use this formulation for this disease" (without explaining why or how it works)

There's no critical thinking, no analytical framework, no invitation to understand the underlying principles.

**4. Exam-Oriented, Not Practice-Oriented**

Most textbooks are written with one goal: help students pass university examinations. They focus on:

- What questions have been asked in previous years
- Short answers and bullet points for quick memorization
- Superficial coverage of vast topics
- Formulaic responses to expected questions

They do NOT prepare you to:

- Think critically about a patient's condition
- Understand the reasoning behind treatment protocols
- Apply principles flexibly to unique clinical situations
- Develop as a competent, confident practitioner

**5. Disconnected from Classical Sources**

Even when these books quote shlokas, they rarely:

- Provide proper context from the original text
- Explain the commentator's interpretation
- Discuss different commentators' perspectives
- Show how the shloka fits into the larger discussion in the Samhita

You get isolated verses floating without foundation, like cut flowers without roots.

**The Culture of Downloaded Notes and Last-Minute Cramming**

Many students have adopted a dangerous approach to their medical education:

**The Typical Pattern:**

- Attend classes irregularly (or not at all)
- Collect notes from seniors or download PDFs
- Ignore studies until two months before exams
- Frantically memorize bullet points
- Regurgitate memorized content in exams
- Forget everything immediately after
- Repeat for the next subject

**The Devastating Consequences:**

- You pass exams but remain clinically incompetent
- You have no real understanding of Ayurvedic principles
- You cannot think independently about cases
- You lack confidence in your own system
- You graduate as a "certified" doctor who doesn't know how to practice medicine

This is not education—it's a sophisticated form of academic fraud that you're perpetrating against yourself.

**Why You Must Study the Original Samhitas**

**The Samhitas Are the Foundation**

Imagine studying architecture without ever looking at foundational principles of design, or learning music without understanding basic theory. That's what studying Ayurveda from guidebooks alone is like.

The Samhitas are not supplementary reading material. They ARE Ayurveda. Everything else is derivative, interpretive, and incomplete.

**What the Samhitas Offer That Textbooks Cannot:**

**1. Complete, Coherent Philosophy**

The Samhitas present Ayurveda as a unified philosophical and practical system. They explain:

- The fundamental nature of reality (Panchamahabhuta, Purusha, Prakriti)
- How the body functions (Dosha-Dhatu-Mala theory)
- The nature of disease and health
- The purpose and goal of medicine
- The ethical foundation of medical practice

Textbooks chop this coherent philosophy into disconnected pieces spread across different subjects.

**2. Logical Reasoning and Analytical Methods**

Every concept in the Samhitas is presented with:

- **Hetu** (causation)
- **Yukti** (reasoning)
- **Pramana** (valid means of knowledge)
- **Upamana** (analogies and examples)

The original texts teach you HOW to think like an Ayurvedic physician, not just WHAT to memorize.

**3. Clinical Wisdom and Practical Insights**

The Samhitas emerged from centuries of clinical observation and practice. They contain:

- Subtle diagnostic indicators
- Prognostic signs
- Treatment modifications based on individual factors
- Therapeutic principles that apply across conditions
- Clinical pearls that only experience can provide

This wisdom is condensed or lost entirely in modern textbooks.

**4. Precise Sanskrit Terminology**

Ayurvedic concepts cannot be fully captured in English translation. Terms like:

- Ojas, Tejas, Prana
- Agni, Ama, Srotas
- Samprapti, Samprapti Bheda
- Doshagati, Margavarodha

These have specific, nuanced meanings in Sanskrit that English approximations cannot convey. Only by studying in the original language do you access the precision of Ayurvedic thought.

**5. Multiple Dimensions of Meaning**

Sanskrit is a layered language. A single shloka can contain:

- Literal meaning (Shabdartha)
- Implied meaning (Lakshyartha)
- Deeper philosophical significance
- Clinical applications
- Preventive implications

The commentaries unpack these layers. Textbooks give you only the surface.

**6. Historical Context and Development**

By reading multiple Samhitas and their commentaries, you understand:

- How concepts evolved over time
- Where different authorities agreed or disagreed
- Why certain treatment approaches developed
- The rationale behind variations in practice

This historical perspective makes you a more thoughtful practitioner.

**The Indispensable Value of Sanskrit Commentaries**

You might think, "I'll read the Samhitas in English translation." That's better than only reading textbooks, but you're still missing the most valuable part: **the Sanskrit commentaries.**

**Who Were the Commentators?**

The great commentators—Chakrapani, Dalhana, Arunadatta, Hemadri, and others—were not just scholars. They were:

- Master physicians with extensive clinical experience
- Profound Sanskrit scholars who understood linguistic nuances
- Philosophers who grasped the deeper implications of the texts
- Teachers who knew how students struggle and what clarifications are needed

Their commentaries are not footnotes—they are essential guides to understanding the original texts correctly.

**What Commentaries Provide:**

**1. Word-by-Word Analysis**

Commentaries break down each shloka, explaining:

- Grammar and syntax
- Multiple meanings of words
- Technical versus common usage
- Why specific words were chosen

**2. Resolution of Ambiguities**

Sanskrit can be intentionally concise, leaving certain things unstated. Commentaries:

- Fill in implicit information
- Clarify elliptical expressions
- Resolve grammatical ambiguities
- Explain contextual references

**3. Clinical Interpretation**

Commentators explain:

- How to apply theoretical concepts clinically
- What specific manifestations look like in practice
- Treatment principles behind formulations
- Practical considerations for different patient types

**4. Philosophical Integration**

They connect Ayurvedic concepts to:

- Broader philosophical frameworks (Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika)
- Ethical and spiritual dimensions
- Psychology and consciousness studies

**5. Cross-References and Comparative Analysis**

Commentaries reference:

- Other sections of the same Samhita
- Other Samhitas and classical texts
- Different authorities' views
- Real clinical examples

**6. Protection Against Misinterpretation**

Without commentaries, you can easily misunderstand the original text. Commentators prevent:

- Literal interpretations of metaphorical statements
- Missing implied conditions or exceptions
- Applying general rules inappropriately
- Overlooking subtle but crucial distinctions

**How Studying Original Texts Transforms Your Understanding**

Let me give you concrete examples of how textbook learning versus Samhita study differs:

**Example 1: Understanding Agni**

**Textbook approach:** "Agni is digestive fire. There are 13 types of Agni. Jatharagni digests food."

**Samhita study reveals:**

- Agni is not just digestion—it's the principle of transformation at every level
- The philosophical basis: Agni represents Tejas Mahabhuta at the biological level
- How Agni relates to Prana, Ojas, and consciousness
- Detailed signs of different states of Agni (Sama, Vishama, Tikshna, Manda)
- How to assess Agni through multiple parameters
- The relationship between Jatharagni and Dhatvagnis
- Why maintaining Agni is the cornerstone of all treatment
- Subtle methods to regulate Agni in different conditions

**Result:** Instead of a memorized fact, you have a deep understanding you can apply clinically.

**Example 2: Nidana Panchaka**

**Textbook approach:** "Nidana Panchaka consists of: 1) Nidana 2) Purvarupa 3) Rupa 4) Upashaya 5) Samprapti. Memorize these for each disease."

**Samhita study reveals:**

- Why these five specifically, and not three or seven
- The logical progression from cause to manifestation
- How to use Nidana Panchaka as a diagnostic framework
- The subtle differences between Purvarupa and Rupa
- How Upashaya-Anupashaya guides differential diagnosis
- The detailed understanding of Samprapti and its variations
- How knowing Samprapti determines treatment
- When to focus on which element of Nidana Panchaka

**Result:** You understand the diagnostic methodology itself, not just disease descriptions.

**Example 3: Drug Properties in Dravyaguna**

**Textbook approach:** "Guduchi: Rasa - Tikta, Kashaya; Virya - Ushna; Vipaka - Madhura; Guna - Laghu, Snigdha. Uses: Jwara, Vatarakta, Prameha."

**Samhita study reveals:**

- How Guduchi's properties work through Rasa-Guna-Virya-Vipaka principles
- Why this specific combination of properties is effective for these conditions
- The Samprapti these conditions share that Guduchi addresses
- Different formulations and why certain combinations enhance effectiveness
- Contraindications and careful use in specific Prakriti types
- The broader principle of how to select drugs based on properties
- Classical formulations containing Guduchi and their specific indications

**Result:** You learn the principles of drug selection, not just memorized facts.

**How to Study the Samhitas: A Practical Guide**

**Getting Started: Overcoming Initial Barriers**

**"But Sanskrit is difficult!"**

Yes, classical Sanskrit requires effort. But:

- You're investing 5.5 years in this education—6 months of serious Sanskrit study will serve you for life
- Medical students around the world learn Latin and Greek terminology
- Sanskrit is YOUR professional language; it should be non-negotiable
- The effort you invest returns manifold in understanding and confidence

**"But Samhitas are huge!"**

You don't read Samhitas cover-to-cover like novels. You study them:

- Section by section, related to your current subjects
- With specific focus based on clinical relevance
- Repeatedly, with deeper understanding each time
- Throughout your career, not just during BAMS

**"But I don't have time!"**

You have time for what you prioritize. If you can:

- Scroll social media for hours
- Watch web series regularly
- Chat with friends extensively

You can dedicate 1-2 hours daily to serious study of your profession's foundational texts.

The question isn't time—it's priority and discipline.

**Step-by-Step Approach to Samhita Study**

**Phase 1: Build Your Sanskrit Foundation (2-6 months)**

**Do not skip this step.** Trying to study Samhitas without adequate Sanskrit is like trying to practice medicine without knowing anatomy.

- **Learn Devanagari script** thoroughly—reading and writing
- **Study basic Sanskrit grammar**: Sandhi (word combinations)
- Vibhakti (case endings)
- Common verb forms
- Basic sentence structure

- **Build medical Sanskrit vocabulary**: Anatomical terms
- Drug names
- Disease terminology
- Common descriptive terms

- **Practice with simple texts** before jumping to Samhitas

**Resources:**

- Join a structured Sanskrit class (online or offline)
- Use Sanskrit learning apps for daily practice
- Study Sanskrit sections in your curriculum seriously, not superficially

**Phase 2: Acquire the Essential Books**

**Invest in good editions.** This is not an area to cut corners or rely on poor-quality PDFs.

**Essential texts to own:**

- **Charaka Samhita** with Chakrapani commentary (Vidyotini Hindi commentary also helpful)
- **Sushruta Samhita** with Dalhana commentary
- **Ashtanga Hridaya** with Arunadatta and Hemadri commentaries
- **Ashtanga Sangraha** (often neglected but valuable)
- **Good Sanskrit-English medical dictionary**
- **Sanskrit grammar reference books**

**Digital resources:**

- NIIMH (National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage) online resources
- Digital Library of India
- Legitimate academic websites (not pirated content)

**Note:** Physical books are preferable for serious study. Reading from screens for extended periods affects retention and leads to distraction.

**Phase 3: Develop a Systematic Study Routine**

**Daily Study Structure (Minimum 1-2 hours):**

**Morning session (45-60 minutes):**

- Select a section relevant to your current subject
- Read the original Sanskrit shloka slowly, aloud if possible
- Break down the grammar and word meanings
- Read the commentator's explanation in Sanskrit
- Understand the clinical or philosophical point being made
- Take detailed notes in your own words

**Evening session (30-45 minutes):**

- Review what you studied in the morning
- Connect to related concepts from other sections
- Think about clinical applications
- Write down questions that arise
- Discuss with study partners or teachers

**Phase 4: Integration with Your Curriculum**

Don't study Samhitas separately from your coursework. Instead, integrate them:

**When studying Sharir (Anatomy):**

- Read relevant sections from Sharira Sthana of all three Samhitas
- Compare how Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata describe structures
- Understand the functional anatomy emphasized in Ayurveda

**When studying Dravyaguna:**

- Study drug descriptions in Sutrasthana and Chikitsa Sthana
- Read Chakrapani's explanations of Rasa-Guna-Virya-Vipaka
- Understand formulation principles from Kalpa Sthana

**When studying Roga Nidana:**

- Study Nidana Sthana thoroughly with commentaries
- Understand Samprapti at the level the Samhitas present
- Learn the diagnostic frameworks comprehensively

**When studying Kayachikitsa:**

- Chikitsa Sthana becomes your primary text
- Study treatment protocols with rationale
- Understand therapeutic principles, not just formulations

**Phase 5: Group Study and Discussion**

Studying Samhitas alone is good; studying with serious peers is better.

**Form a Samhita study circle:**

- 3-5 committed students
- Meet 2-3 times weekly
- Each session: one person presents a section they've studied
- Others question, discuss, analyze
- Debate different interpretations
- Share clinical connections

**Benefits of group study:**

- Different people notice different aspects
- Explaining to others deepens your understanding
- Questions from peers reveal gaps in understanding
- Healthy competition motivates consistent study
- Develops confidence in discussing classical texts

**Phase 6: Connect with Teachers and Scholars**

Don't struggle alone with difficult passages.

**Seek guidance from:**

- Professors who have deep knowledge of Samhitas (identify them)
- Visiting scholars during workshops
- Senior practitioners who studied classically
- Online forums with qualified respondents

**Approach them with:**

- Specific, well-formulated questions
- Evidence that you've tried to understand independently
- Genuine interest in learning
- Respect for their knowledge and time

**What to Avoid in Samhita Study**

**❌ Don't:**

- **Read only translations** without attempting the Sanskrit
- **Skip commentaries** thinking the original text is enough
- **Study randomly** without connecting to a systematic framework
- **Memorize without understanding** the logic and reasoning
- **Study only for exams** and forget immediately after
- **Rely solely on class notes** about what Samhitas say
- **Get discouraged** by initial difficulty—persevere through the challenging beginning phase
- **Study in isolation** without ever discussing or teaching others
- **Ignore practical application**—always think about clinical relevance
- **Treat Samhitas as religious texts**—they're scientific medical literature

**✓ Do:**

- **Be patient with yourself**—this is a gradual, lifelong process
- **Maintain consistency**—daily study is better than occasional marathons
- **Take detailed notes**—writing aids understanding and retention
- **Ask questions**—no question is too basic if you genuinely want to know
- **Compare different Samhitas** on the same topic
- **Read actively**—think critically, don't just passively absorb
- **Apply to cases**—constantly connect theory to clinical reality
- **Review regularly**—revisit sections with deeper perspective
- **Build your personal reference system**—index important sections
- **Share your learning**—teach juniors, discuss with peers

**Addressing Common Excuses and Objections**

**"But the university curriculum doesn't require deep Samhita study"**

**Response:** The curriculum sets minimum requirements for passing exams. It does NOT define what's required to become a competent physician.

Do you want to be a student who merely passed exams, or a skilled practitioner who can confidently treat patients? The choice—and responsibility—is yours.

**"Textbooks are easier and sufficient for exams"**

**Response:** True, guidebooks might get you through exams with less effort. But:

- What about after you graduate? Will guidebooks help you treat complex cases?
- Do you want your practice limited to whatever those guidebooks covered?
- Patients deserve doctors who actually understand their system of medicine
- Your professional reputation will depend on competence, not exam marks

Short-term convenience leads to long-term incompetence.

**"I'll study Samhitas after BAMS, once I have more time"**

**Response:** This rarely happens because:

- After graduation, pressure to establish practice becomes overwhelming
- Without foundation built during BAMS, self-study becomes much harder
- Clinical demands leave even less time for systematic study
- Habits formed now determine future practice patterns

**Now** is when you have dedicated time for learning. Use it wisely.

**"My seniors passed without studying Samhitas, so can I"**

**Response:** Look honestly at those seniors' clinical competence:

- How confident are they in their Ayurvedic practice?
- Do they truly understand the principles they claim to follow?
- Are they successful practitioners, or struggling to establish themselves?
- Do they have to rely heavily on allopathic prescriptions?

Success in exams ≠ Success as a practitioner.

Do you want to follow a pattern that produces mediocre doctors, or set a higher standard for yourself?

**"Sanskrit commentaries are too difficult; I'll just read translations"**

**Response:** Yes, commentaries are challenging initially. But:

- Difficulty is exactly why they're valuable—they make you think deeply
- Translations lose nuance, precision, and multiple layers of meaning
- The effort you invest in understanding commentaries trains your analytical mind
- Once you develop the skill, it becomes progressively easier
- The clinical insights hidden in commentaries are worth the effort

Don't choose easy over excellent.

**The Long-Term Consequences of Your Choice**

**Path A: Textbook-Only Approach**

**During BAMS:**

- Easy, superficial learning
- Less time investment
- Pass exams adequately
- Graduate on schedule

**After BAMS:**

- Shallow understanding of Ayurvedic principles
- Lack of confidence in your own system
- Difficulty handling complex cases
- Dependence on allopathic medicines
- Professional insecurity
- Limited growth potential

**Lifetime result:** You become a doctor with a certificate but without true expertise. You spend your career feeling inadequate, wishing you had learned more deeply when you had the chance.

**Path B: Samhita-Based Approach**

**During BAMS:**

- Challenging, demanding work
- Significant time investment
- Deep understanding
- Strong foundation
- Genuine confidence

**After BAMS:**

- Thorough understanding of Ayurvedic principles
- Ability to think independently about cases
- Confidence in your clinical decisions
- Skill to handle complex conditions
- Professional credibility
- Continuous growth

**Lifetime result:** You become a respected practitioner with deep knowledge, growing expertise, and the satisfaction of truly helping patients with authentic Ayurvedic care.

**Which path will you choose?**

**A Challenge and an Invitation**

**The Challenge**

I challenge you to try this for just three months:

- Dedicate 1.5 hours daily to serious Samhita study
- Focus on sections relevant to your current subjects
- Study with Sanskrit text and commentaries
- Take detailed notes
- Discuss weekly with study partners

After three months, honestly assess:

- Has your understanding deepened?
- Do you feel more confident?
- Can you think more analytically about cases?
- Are you seeing connections you missed before?

If you can sincerely say there's no benefit, return to your guidebooks. But give it an honest try first.

**The Invitation**

You're part of a lineage of healers stretching back millennia. The Samhitas are your inheritance—the distilled wisdom of countless physicians, philosophers, and teachers.

They're not being withheld from you. They're sitting there, waiting. The only barrier is your decision to engage with them or not.

This is an invitation to:

- **Claim your heritage** as an Ayurvedic physician
- **Honor the tradition** you've chosen to enter
- **Develop real expertise** rather than superficial knowledge
- **Become the practitioner** your future patients deserve
- **Experience the joy** of deep learning and discovery

The Samhitas are profound, challenging, and immensely rewarding. They will frustrate you sometimes, but they will also illuminate your understanding in ways guidebooks never can.

**Conclusion: The Choice That Defines Your Career**

Every BAMS student faces a fork in the road:

**One path** is easy, comfortable, and crowded. It's paved with downloaded PDFs, guidebooks, and last-minute cramming. It leads to graduation and certification—but also to professional mediocrity, self-doubt, and unfulfilled potential.

**The other path** is demanding, sometimes steep, and less traveled. It requires discipline, patience, and genuine effort. But it leads to deep understanding, clinical competence, professional confidence, and the profound satisfaction of mastering your craft.

You cannot walk both paths. And the choice you make during BAMS determines which practitioner you become.

**A Final Plea**

Don't be the generation of Ayurvedic doctors who never read the foundational texts of their own system.

Don't graduate claiming to practice Ayurveda while knowing it only through secondhand summaries.

Don't let the profound wisdom of the Samhitas remain locked away while you rely on poor-quality compilations.

Don't waste these years—the dedicated learning time you have now will never return.

**Study the Samhitas.**

Study them in Sanskrit, with commentaries, with attention and respect. Study them not because exams require it, but because your professional integrity demands it. Study them because your future patients deserve a doctor who truly understands the system they're seeking help from.

The Samhitas are not obstacles to overcome—they are treasures to discover.

Open them. Read them. Struggle with them. Understand them. Let them transform your education from memorization to mastery.

Your patients, your profession, and your own future self will thank you.

**"One must study the beneficial sciences with effort. This is the science of purpose—all three (body, mind, and spirit) are integrated here."**

— Charaka Samhita

The wisdom awaits. Will you claim it?
